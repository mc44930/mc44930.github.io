<h1>The Better Head Coach</h1> 
	<p> Over the years, the Georgia Bulldogs have been more than adequate, but there is something special about this years team. The new head coach, Kirby Smart, has managed to take lead the bulldogs to the national championship game after only two seasons.</p>
	<p> Mark Richt was a fine coach, but has Kirby already proven to be a better one? This chart shows a comparison of Kirby smarts best season coaching the bulldogs and Mark Richts.</p>
	<p> By showing the wins and losses in their best recorded seasons, we can come to a reasonable conclusion of who was the better head coach for this Georgia Bulldog team.</p>

<p> Mark Richt's best season win percentage has proven to be higher than Kirby Smart's, but the victor of the debate is very difficult to determine. Kirby has been a the bulldogs head coach for only two seasons now so he has a lot left to prove. On the other hand, Mark Richt's best season coaching the Georgia Bulldogs was also his second season as head coach. Both men were excellent coaches, but only time will tell who is the best.
